# LectureGenie

## Project Description

A telegram bot that extracts summaries, questions and answers from lecture videos and provides notion links containing the question and answers to view, organise and revise lecture materials better.

As students, we understand the challenge of extracting all necessary information from lengthy lecture materials and organizing them in a way that promotes effective revision. This is why our solution targets school and university students who struggle with this problem.
